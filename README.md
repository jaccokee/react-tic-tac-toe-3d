This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project was based on the tic-tac-toe [react tutorial]
(https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html#).

## 3D tic-tac-toe...something; FOUR in a row!

- Two players, X and O
- Players alternate taking turns on the same device
- Future considerations:
  - Add Redux
  - Update display
  - Add "undo" feature
  - Add server for remote games
  - Add rotation controls
